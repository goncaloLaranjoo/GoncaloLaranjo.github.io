# Goncalo Laranjo's Course Project Portfolio

## Semester 1 
#### (FINISHED)
### Object-Oriented Programming
- During the first semester, I delved into Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), focusing on core principles such as classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation. Through hands-on projects and coding exercises, I gained a strong foundation in designing and structuring software efficiently. This experience allowed me to develop problem-solving skills and apply OOP concepts to real-world applications, enhancing my ability to create modular and maintainable code.
 
- For my last assignment I had to create a program for a made up company called the CarCo car dealership that operates an inventory system where car details for current, ordered and in-delivery vehicles are stored and managed. The system had to be adaptive to the ever evolving car market and must manage stock for petrol, electric and plugin hybrid cars.

- I will now show you the work I did through this assignment.

- First I started by completing a UML diagram to have a complete structure for my program.
- The Car Class (UML)

- After producing the UML diagram, I could finally start on the project in Java using Eclipse IDE, here is the code I produced that made my working project:

- This foundation allowed me to enhance my problem-solving skills and create efficient, modular code. For my final assignment, I developed an inventory system for a fictional car dealership, CarCo. The system tracks current, ordered, and in-delivery vehicles, managing stock for petrol, electric, and plugin hybrid cars, and is adaptable to the dynamic car market.

### Introduction to Networking
- In Introduction to Networking, I have learned the fundamentals of computer networking, including concepts such as IP addressing, subnetting, network protocols, and routing. Through hands-on projects and exercises, I have gained practical experience in configuring and troubleshooting networks, as well as understanding how devices communicate across different layers of the OSI model. Strengthening my knowledge of networking essentials, preparing me for real-world applications in IT and network management.
  
- I have used software such as Cisco Packet Tracer, Windows Server and VMWare Horizon to create and manage virtual machines to emulate a real job world experience, creating environments for staff and managing servers.

- Here are a few examples below of the work I have done throughout my most recent assignment:

- I started by making my own domain controller/ server, along with the two computers to test run all the users accounts I made through the domain controller, to create and manage everything for the users.

- I installed DNS and DHCP services for two reasons firstly DNS enables the use of easy-to-remember domain names, helping users access services and websites by translating them into machine-understandable IP addresses, while DHCP automates the assignment of IP addresses to devices on a network, making it easier to manage network resources and preventing conflicts between devices.

- Here are the Active Directory features:
  
![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f6c91cd9-6ac5-4a7e-94cc-ec83cc0a9300)

- Certain users need different logon hours I have applied these using the active directory tools so that the users are only permitted to login at certain hours.

- Using the active directory I made it possible to only have complex passwords available if the password meets the minimum complexity requirements.

- I implemented file shares and NTFS share permissions by separating certain users between the users and administrators I can make USERS only be able to Read & Execute, List folder contents, and Read. 

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/af132fc4-0d8a-46d9-a979-63589b904f5b)

- I used ipconfig /all to show that all computers are connected to the same server.
