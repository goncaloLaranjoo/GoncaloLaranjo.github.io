## Semester 1 
### Object-Oritented Programming
- During the first semester, I delved into Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), focusing on core principles such as classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation. Through hands-on projects and coding exercises, I gained a strong foundation in designing and structuring software efficiently. This experience allowed me to develop problem-solving skills and apply OOP concepts to real-world applications, enhancing my ability to create modular and maintainable code.
 
- For my last assignment I had to create a program for a made up company called the CarCo car dealership that operates an inventory system where car details for current, ordered and in-delivery vehicles are stored and managed. The system had to be adaptive to the ever evolving car market and must manage stock for petrol, electric and plugin hybrid cars.

- I will now show you the work I did through this assignment.

- First I started by completing a UML diagram to have a complete structure for my program.
- The Car Class (UML)

- After producing the UML diagram, I could finally start on the project in Java using Eclipse IDE, here is the code I produced that made my working project:

- This foundation allowed me to enhance my problem-solving skills and create efficient, modular code. For my final assignment, I developed an inventory system for a fictional car dealership, CarCo. The system tracks current, ordered, and in-delivery vehicles, managing stock for petrol, electric, and plugin hybrid cars, and is adaptable to the dynamic car market.
